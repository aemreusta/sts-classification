                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                <p>Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are rare and heterogeneous malignant tumors with over a hundred histological subtypes, posing significant diagnostic challenges due to their varied prognostic and clinical features. This project aims to develop an automated classification system for four STS subtypes: Rhabdomyosarcoma, Leiomyosarcoma, Synovial Sarcoma, and Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors, using deep learning models. High-resolution Hematoxylin & Eosin-stained images from the TCGA-SARC dataset and Istanbul University-Cerrahpaşa archives were used. The dataset was annotated and processed, involving masking and tiling operations to generate frames with at least 60% tumorous tissue. Pre-trained models like ResNet50V2, VGG19, InceptionV3, and EfficientNetV2S were tested for classification accuracy using cross-validation, with ResNet50V2 achieving the highest performance. Transfer learning was employed to maintain high-resolution details while optimizing inference times. The project demonstrated that deep learning models could significantly improve the diagnostic process for STS, potentially reducing diagnostic time and pathologists' workload. Future work will focus on integrating these models into clinical practice and expanding the dataset to enhance model robustness.</p>
