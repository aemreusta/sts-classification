# Soft Tissue Sarcoma Classification - Graduation Project

This project investigates the application of Deep Learning for automated classification of Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS) subtypes.

## Project Goals

- Develop a system to classify four STS subtypes: Rhabdomyosarcoma, Leiomyosarcoma, Synovial Sarcoma, and Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors.
- Leverage deep learning models for improved diagnostic accuracy.

## Project Highlights

- High-resolution Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) stained images were used for training.
- Pre-trained models like ResNet50V2 achieved high classification accuracy.
- Transfer learning optimized performance while preserving image details.

## Benefits

- Potential to reduce diagnostic time and workload for pathologists.
- Enhanced diagnostic process for STS.

## Future Directions

- Integrate the model into clinical practice.
- Expand the dataset for improved model robustness.
